# project-dungeon

This is an open-source creative software project made by Latent Arcana. The intent of this project is to entertain and educate. 

This project is still in development. Please feel free to use and reuse the code present in this repository to make your own games. Note that it does rely on the use of Unity and Unity Engine. Much of the code, especially the dungeon generation algorithms, can be reused outside of Unity however.

Please use at your own risk while this project is in development. When the project is complete it will be updated and this README will explain the required steps to run and manage a project-dungeon instance. You will also be able to download the game on itch.io!
